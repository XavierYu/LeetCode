#Time Complexity: Number of comparison, computation
O(N)
O(N^2) quadralic complexity, 10^2 =100, computation time increasely drmatically

#Space Complexity:Unit Memory needed to run the process at any point of time
f(x) calls itself recurcively twice:
O(N^3), called internally, function not end, N+N+N
